Implement a Login screen with the following components:

1. A MFA switch component
2. Email field
3. Password field
4. Conditional MFA field that appears only if the switch is true
5. Log In button similar to the Sign Up button. If the validation is correct, go to the Success page.

Caveats: If the MFA is not active, the validation only applies for the email and password. You must have a conditional validation for the MFA field. Is it possible to have multiple schemas in Zod? ðŸ¤”
